by users and can be highly beneficial in terms of dealing with problems involving solid waste management. This application will lead its users to the nearest junk shops that can help them collect their junk at home and can help determine the value of their junk based on the amount of a specific item to be collected. This idea was produced by Grade 12 STEM Engineering students who are currently studying at Marcelo H. del Pilar National High School."
